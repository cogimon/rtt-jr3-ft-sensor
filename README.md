# rtt-jr3-ft-sensor
RTT interface for JR3 force-troque sensor. This, hopefully will provide realtime communication with the sensor. Currently we have a ROS interface thanks to Arne and David Oeser (maintainer) will bring this to RTT.

## Usage

## Hardware and software dependencies
### Hardware:
The sensor connects to a PCI port through a cable that looks like a phone cable. We need to check there are any gimmicks.

### Software:

## TODO
   1. Fork the real code
   2. Add credit for Arne and David
   3. Remove the placeholder (`.keep') files.
   4. Possibly add a form transformation to express the frame to which the sensor is attached.
