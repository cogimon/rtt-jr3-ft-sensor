1. Make a copy of the folder containing the driver's source files.

2. Open a terminal window and navigate into the duplicated folder.

3. Build and install the driver:

	make
	sudo cp jr3pci-driver.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/
	sudo depmod
	sudo modprobe jr3pci-driver
	echo jr3pci-driver | sudo tee -a /etc/modules

4. Open /etc/rc.local as root and insert the following *above* the "exit 0" line

	chmod o+rw /dev/jr3

4. Reboot the PC.

5. Build and run the test applications:

	sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
	make test
	make jr3mon
	./test
	./jr3mon

Note: Building and installing the driver has to be done again after an OS kernel update.
